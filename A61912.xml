            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THAT the Reader may the better apprehend our deſign and aim, we have thought fit to premiſe ſome things concerning the Methods, both general and particular, we make uſe of in the following Treatiſe. For as heretofore a ſort of a blind deference to, and ſuperſtitious Veneration of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and eſpecially of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> has hindred the growth and progreſs of Natural Philoſophy, which of late has made ſuch conſiderable advances, ſince it has ventured to ſtand upon its own Bottom, to make new Additions to former Inventions, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay new and unknown Objects, to ſubſtitute Things inſtead of Names, Certainties inſtead of Doubts, and Experience in the room of dull Credulities; not derogating in the mean while from the deſerved Praiſes of the Ingenious among the Ancients: So without doubt Mathematicks alſo, unleſs our Predeceſſors had imagined that it had long ago been brought to its utmoſt Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by <hi>Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius,</hi> and other Ingenious Ancients, would have arrived long ſince to a higher pitch, and by this time have ſurpaſs'd thoſe Limits, which now we admire its arrival to.</p>

               <p>It is confeſs'd by all, that no Human Knowledge whatſoever can lay a more juſt claim to an unſhaken Evidence and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or boaſt an higher neceſſity of its Demonſtrations, or a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er multitude of undeniable Truths, than the Mathematicks; and that thoſe Propoſitions we have, found out by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> demonſtrated by <hi>Euclid, Apollonius,</hi> and others, are at the ſame time unqueſtionable and altogether wonderful. But we may with Truth affirm, that moſt of their Propoſitions may either be diſpoſed in a better order, or propounded eaſier, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated more evidently and directly, or taught after a more ſhort and compendious way, now at leaſt after they are already found out, and with a great deal of Pains demonſtrated by their firſt Inventors; and of this Opinion are ſeveral of the beſt and moſt celebrated Mathematicians of the preſent Age.</p>

               <p>It is certain <hi>Euclid</hi> has demonſtrated ſeveral Propoſitions, (as <hi>Prop. 2, 3, 20, 30, lib. 1. 2, 5, 6, 10, 15, 28, 29, lib. 3.</hi> &amp;c.) whoſe Truth to any attentive Perſon appears from the very terms, more clearly and certainly than the truth of <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom 13. lib. 1.</hi> which his Interpreters dare not admit without a Demonſtration. And tho' thoſe ſuperfluous Demonſtrations derogate nothing from the certitude of the thing, yet by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary increaſe of the number of Propoſitions, and (which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follows thence) an inverting the order of things, they breed Tediouſneſs and Confuſion.</p>

               <p>Then as for the method of Demonſtrating uſed by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; it is true that it nicely regarded the certainty of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, nor would it admit any thing into its Demonſtrations, which was not either a firſt Principle and ſo ſelf evident, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them an <hi>Axiom</hi>) or might not be ſuppoſed, beyond all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, poſſible to be effected (and on that account named a <hi>Poſtulate</hi>) or, thirdly, an arbitrary Denomination of the thing propoſed which needed no Demonſtration, (and was called a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition or Explication of a Term;) or, laſtly, which had not been evidently demonſtrated before: Yet I believe none will deny, but that this Method would have been more deſervedly eſteem'd, if with the certainty of its Concluſions it had joined a greater Eaſineſs, Brevity, and Evidence, which is wanting in moſt of the Demonſtrations of the Ancients; who thought it enough, firmly and infallibly to eſtabliſh the truth of their Theorems, and extort the Aſſent of their Readers; little regarding by what Ambages, by how many circumambulatory Propoſitions, and almoſt whole Volumes, it was done; that thereby they might be forced to acknowledge the thing to be ſo, while how it came to be ſo, or from what intrinſick Cauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But it would be in vain for us to attempt, in this place, to explain all and each of thoſe various methods at length; having only propoſed to our ſelves, to demonſtrate the chief and principal Theorems and Inventions of the Mathematicks, and to uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of them, and ſometimes another, (having firſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated their Foundations) according as we ſhall judge this or that of them, fitteſt to Demonſtrate the thing in hand, and ſo ſhew the reaſons, and uſe of each of them in the proceſs of this diſcourſe. And altho' <hi>H.

<pb facs="tcp:43963:6"/> Principles, than which nothing is more eaſie: And this is that which we deſign to do, and ſo uſe the learner by degrees to this ſort of Demonſtration, thereby to prepare him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Analytick Geometry of the Moderns, which is the higheſt <hi>apex</hi> of the Mathematicks. But we had rather our Reader ſhould himſelf find, than we trouble our ſelves any further to tell him here, how compendiouſly we Demonſtrate the Propoſitions of Geometry, by the help of theſe Analytick notes, without the tedious Concatenation of a long Chain of Conſequences, which would be otherwiſe unavoidable.</p>

               <p>After this way we deſign to go through the following Scheme. <hi>1.</hi> We ſhall deduce ſeveral propoſitions of <hi>Euclid, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> from our definitions, and the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Magnitudes therein propoſed; as Corollaries neceſſarily flowing from them, and confirm'd only by an immediate and ſimple conſequence. <hi>2.</hi> We ſhall demonſtrate their chief Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems (for the ſake of which they were forced to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſeveral others before hand, the knowledge whereof for their own ſake was not ſo neceſſary or valuable) without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long ſeries of antecedent Propoſitions, or Foreign princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from a few direct and intrinſick Principles of their own. Whence <hi>3.</hi> It will follow, that after this Method we ſhall propoſe things, and treat of them; in a more natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and firſt of all deliver thoſe which are moſt univerſal and common to all quantities, and then deſcend to thoſe which in a more ſpecial manner regard Magnitude, and diſtribute and diſpoſe all according to certain general diſtinct Claſſes of the things to be treated of, and their affections. Hence alſo <hi>4.</hi> We deduce from thoſe univerſal Theorems, by way of Corollary, the Precepts of vulgar Arithmetick, and ſpecious Computation, which afterwards we make uſe of in particular Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after a very ſhort and compendious way; and, for this very reaſon, ſome Learned men of the preſent Age are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Ancients often fell into that tedious and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate prolixity in their Demonſtrations, becauſe they would not acknowledge the great affinity there was between Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb facs="tcp:43963:6"/> and Geometry, taking particular care not to introduce the Terms and Operations of Arithmetick into Geometry; tho' at the ſame time they never ſcrupled to transfer the names of Plan, Square, Cube, and ſuch like to numbers. <hi>5.</hi> Laſtly, Having firſt Demonſtrated the firſt and Fundamental Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems of Elementary Geometry, we may ſafely build on them the <hi>Praxes</hi> of all kinds of Mathematical Arts, that are moſt uſeful and requiſite to ſeveral Exigencies of human Life, as, firſt, <hi>Trigonometry</hi> both Plain and Spherical, the Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and uſe of the Tables of Sines and Tangents. <hi>2.</hi> The <hi>Conſtruction</hi> of <hi>Logarithms,</hi> and a compendious application of them to <hi>Trigonometry:</hi> And in the <hi>3.</hi> and laſt place, the fundamental Precepts of Algebra, or the Analytic Art; by the help whereof the learner may at length arrive to the higher and more recluſe parts of Geometry, and become maſter thereof: Not to mention ſeveral Geometrical and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical Problems, which we have all along derived from ſeveral of our Theorems, by way of Corollary, which it may be ſome other time, may make an Appendix of this work.</p>

                              <p>IT may not be amiſs here to note by the by (altho it may ſeem more proper to be taught after the Doctrin of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions) that if, <hi>v. g.</hi> the degrees of a greater Circle be each of them reſpectively double, or triple, or quadruple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the degrees of a leſs Circle, according as the Radius of the one is double or triple to the Radius of the other, then, at leaſt as far as Mechanical Practice can require, you may find the Arch of a greater Circle equal to the whole Periphery of a leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> if you take reciprocally that part of the greater Periphery, which ſhall be as the Radius of the leſs to the Radius of the greater, or as one degree of the leſs Periphery to one degree of the greater. <hi>e. g.</hi> if the leſs Radius <hi>bc</hi> be half the greater BC, and ſo alſo the Periphery, and each of the degrees of the one, be one half of the Periphery, and of each of the degrees of the other, one half of the greater Periphery will reciprocally be equal to the whole leſs Periphery, or 180 degrees of the one to 360 of the other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <p n="2">2. The ſame (at leaſt in this caſe where the Radius <hi>cb</hi> is double of the Radius CB) may be done alſo Geometrically by the ſame reaſon. Having deſcribed Circles on each Radius, ſuppoſe the Radius CB (<hi>Fig.</hi> 15.) ſo to move with an equable motion about its Center <hi>c,</hi> as to take or move the Radius of the greater Circle <hi>cb</hi> along with it, and coming, <hi>v. g.</hi> to I. ſtops that alſo at 1, and going forward, to II. ſtops that again at 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it will be manifeſt to any attentive Reader, that when the leſs Radius CB ſhall have deſcribed the Semicircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference B. II. III. the greater Radius <hi>cb</hi> having moved to 3, will have deſcribed preciſely a quarter of its circumference;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43963:18"/> and if ſtill the leſs Radius C. IV. moves on to the right hand, and continues to carry the greater <hi>c</hi> 4 along with it onwards the ſame way, it will neceſſarily follow, that in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Radius C. IV. (together with <hi>c</hi> 4.) ſhall come to its firſt ſituation in B, having deſcribed a whole Circle, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Radius <hi>c</hi> 4 will be come to 5, and have deſcribed half its Circle, having moved all along with an equal Motion. Hence it is evident, that the whole leaſt Circle anſwers exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to half the greater, and half of the firſt to a quarter of the laſt; as alſo the Quadrant B. II. to the Octant (or 8th. part) <hi>b</hi> 2, &amp;c. whence any Arch being given, as B. I. in the leaſt Circle, if you draw thro' I the Radius of the greater Circle <hi>c</hi> 1. you'l cut off an Arch <hi>b</hi> 1. equal to the given Arch in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, but only half in the number of degrees.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Hence follows naturally that celebrated Propoſition of <hi>Euclid,</hi> that the Angle at the Center BC. I. or BC.

                                 </note>4. Hence we have a new way of biſecting any given Angle CDE, or Arch CE (<hi>Fig.</hi> 17.) <hi>viz.</hi> if you make C<hi>B</hi> equal to the Leg DC, and from this, as Radius, deſcribe an Arch <hi>B</hi>F equal to the Arch CE, and draw DF.</p>
                              <p>And with the ſame facility we might obtain the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, if the greater Radius being triple to the leſs, was thus carried along by an equable Motion, as we have ſhewn how to do already in a double Radius; and this at firſt ſight may ſeem very probable.</p>
                              <p>But whether the triple Radius be immediately carried round by the ſimple Radius C<hi>B,</hi> or by means of the double Radius <hi>cb,</hi> neither the one nor the other will cauſe an equable Motion. For in the latter Caſe, while the Radius <hi>cb</hi> deſcribes the quadrant <hi>Bb,</hi> the Radius <hi>de</hi> will not deſcribe ſo much as a Quadrant; but while <hi>cb</hi> with the ſame velocity deſcribes the other Quadrant <hi>bf,</hi> the Radius <hi>de</hi> will come to <hi>g,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing an Arch as much greater than a Quadrant as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43963:18"/> was leſs. In the former caſe on the contrary, the Radius C<hi>B</hi> moved on to D beyond a Quadrant, while <hi>de</hi> was carried from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>e,</hi> but if the Radius CD moving on, ſhould again carry <hi>de</hi> along with it, the one would deſcribe the ſame Arch <hi>eB,</hi> while the other would deſcribe one leſs than before.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Hence the Angle at the Center ACE (<hi>F g.</hi> 19.) upon the Arch AE, is equal to the Angle <hi>ADB</hi> at the Periphery, upon double that Arch <hi>AB.</hi>

In a Right Angled Triangle BAC (Fig.</hi> 29.) <hi>the Square of the greateſt Side oppoſite to the Right Angle, is equal to the Squares of the other two Sides taken together.</hi> For having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Squares of the other two Sides, AC <hi>dE,</hi> DE <hi>ab</hi> (taking ED=AB) and the Square of the greateſt BC <hi>cb,</hi> it will be evident, that the parts X and Z are common to each, and that the two other Triangles in the greateſt Square BAC and <hi>BDb,</hi> are equal to the two Triangles <hi>bac</hi> and <hi>Cdc</hi> which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43963:22"/> remain in the two Squares of the leſſer Sides; and ſo the whole truth of the Propoſition will be evident, while theſe two things are undoubtedly true: 1.

The ſaid two Triangles are every way equal; for the Angles at C with the intermediate one at Z, make two Right ones, therefore they are equal; but the Side <hi>CA</hi> is equal to the Side <hi>cd,</hi> and <hi>CB</hi> to <hi>Cc,</hi> and the Angles at <hi>A</hi> and <hi>d</hi> Right ones. Wherefore if we conceive the Triangle <hi>ABC</hi> to to be turned about <hi>C,</hi> as a Center to the right hand, it will exactly agree with the Triangle <hi>Cdc,</hi> and the Point <hi>B</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall on the continued Line <hi>d E,</hi> as agreeing with the Line <hi>AB.</hi> Hence it is now evident, that <hi>Ca</hi>=<hi>BD,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ba</hi> is alſo = <hi>bD,</hi> and the Angles at <hi>a</hi> and <hi>D</hi> Right ones.

Wherefore the Product is √15; and ſo the Rule for Multiplying Surd Quantities is this: <hi>Multiply the Quantity under the Radical Signs, and prefix a Radical Sign to the Product.</hi>

                              <p>FRom what we have hitherto Demonſtrated, we may not only make an eſtimate of Magnitudes of the ſame kind compared together, which is eaſie to any one who attentively conſiders them; but alſo with <hi>F. Morgues,</hi> deduce a General Rule of expreſſing the Proportions of any Rectilinear Planes or Solids, contained under
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43963:62"/> Plane Surfaces, by the proportion of one Right Line to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For ſince the one may be reſolved into Triangles, and the other into Pyramids, having firſt two Rectilinear Planes given and thus reſolved, upon a Right Line I make the ▵ <hi>abc (Fig.</hi> 49.) Equal to one of the Triangles of either of the Planes <hi>e. g.</hi> to ABC; then having drawn the Parallel <hi>cm,</hi> if the ▵ BCD has the ſame Altitude with the former, you need only joyn the Baſe BC to the Baſe <hi>ab.</hi> But if the Altitude DS is greater than the Altitude of the other <hi>e. g.</hi> by ⅕, then you muſt make <hi>b f</hi> equal to the Baſe <hi>bc</hi> augmented by a fifth part, and the Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>bcf</hi> will = BCD, and the whole <hi>acf</hi> = to the Rectilinear Figure ABCD. If now therefore I likewiſe make another Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle <hi>ghi</hi> equal to another Rectilinear Figure between the ſame Parallels, then will the ▵ <hi>acf</hi> be to the ▵ <hi>ghi,</hi> that is, the Right Lined Figure ABCD to the Right Lined Figure FGHIK, as <hi>af</hi> to <hi>gh,</hi> by <hi>Prop.</hi> 28. 2. Having 2 Right Lined Solids gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and having reſolved them into Triangular Pyramids, they may be transferr'd between 2 parallel Planes, <hi>viz.</hi> by augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diminſhing their Triangular Baſes reciprocally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exceſs or defect of their Altitudes, as was done above with the Linear Baſes; then thoſe Triangular Baſes on both ſides may be converted into one Triangular Baſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently each Solid into a Pyramid equal to it ſelf; which two Pyramids will be one to the other as their Triangular Baſes. And becauſe the Proportions of theſe Baſes may be reduced to the Proportion of two Lines each to the other, by N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. of this; therefore alſo the Reaſon or Proportion of the two Solids may be expreſſed by the Proportion of two Lines.

That this will be a parabola is evident from the foregoing Conſect. becauſe as the whole thred is always = to the ruler IH; ſo the part GN is always neceſſarily equal to the part GH, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the line FO. Moreover from the ſame ſixth Conſect. and <hi>Fig.</hi> 116. may be drawn another eaſie way of deſcribing the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola in <hi>Plano</hi> from the <hi>Focus</hi> and Vertex given thro' innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable points G to be found after the ſame way: <hi>viz.</hi> If from any aſſumed point in the ax F you draw to the ax a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and at the interval FO from the <hi>Focus</hi> N you make an interſection in G.

                              <p>As to the hyperbola, there is a mechanick method of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that alſo, not unlike the others, from a like property in that, communicated by the ſame <hi>Van Schooten, viz.</hi> If ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the <hi>Focus's</hi> N and <hi>n (Fig.</hi> 129. <hi>n.</hi> 3.) you tye a thread NFO in the <hi>Focus</hi> N and at the end of the ruler <hi>n</hi>O of the length of the tranſverſe ax DE; then putting in a pen or the moveable leg of a pair of compaſſes (nor would it be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to accommodate the practice we before made uſe of to this alſo) draw or move it within the thread NFO from O to E, ſo that the part of the thread NO may always keep cloſe to the ruler as if it were glued to it. For if we call the length of the thread X, and the tranſverſe ax <hi>ob</hi> as above, the ruler <hi>n</hi>O will be, by the Hypoth. = X + <hi>ob.</hi> Make now the part of the thread OF = ½ X, the remainder or other part will be NF = ½ X and <hi>n</hi>F = ½ X + <hi>ob,</hi> and the difference between FN and F<hi>n,</hi> = <hi>ob.</hi> Make OF = ¾ X, then will FN be ½ X and F<hi>n</hi> ¼ X + <hi>ob,</hi> the difference ſtill remaining <hi>ob</hi> and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> In ſhort, ſince the difference of the whole thread and of the whole ruler is <hi>ob,</hi> and in drawing them, the ſame OF is taken from both, there will always be the ſame difference of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders. Hence alſo aſſuming at pleaſure the points N and <hi>n</hi> you may deſcribe hyperbola's ſo, the thread NFO be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ruler <hi>n</hi>FO: For if it were equal there would be deſcribed a right line perpendicular to N<hi>n,</hi> thro' the middle point C.</p>
                              <p>There yet remains one method of deſcribing hyperbola's and ellipſes in <hi>Plano,</hi> by finding the ſeveral points without the help or <hi>Apparatus</hi> of any threads or inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ellipſis, having given or aſſumed the tranſverſe axis DE and the <hi>Foci</hi> N and <hi>n (Fig.</hi> 130. <hi>n.</hi> 1.) if from N at any arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſtance, but not greater than half the tranſverſe ax NF, you make an arch, and keeping the ſame opening of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes

                              <p>TO theſe ſhort Demonſtrations, which we confeſs we owe for the moſt part to <hi>Hon.

But here we will give it the Reader more plain, and free from all Scruples, and likewiſe much eaſier. It is perform'd in theſe inferences, 1. That the right lined Parallelogram A<hi>ba</hi>B (<hi>Fig.</hi> 149 <hi>n.</hi> 1) is equal to the curvilinear ſpace A<hi>bda</hi>BDA.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43963:140"/> 2. That as that is divided into two equal parts by its right li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diagonal A<hi>a,</hi> ſo likewiſe is this by the ſemi-cycloid A<hi>aa,</hi> ſo that the right lined triangle A<hi>a</hi>B is equal to the curvilinear ſpace A<hi>aa</hi>BDA. 3. Therefore the one as well as the other is equal to the generating circle; and conſequently, 4 If to this curvilinear ſpace there be added the ſemi-circle ADBA the ſemi-cycloidal ſpace A<hi>aa</hi>BA will be equal to three ſemi-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The firſt is evident, while if you take from the right lined parallelogram the ſemi-circle ADBA on the one ſide, and on the other add the ſemi-circle <hi>abda,</hi> there will ariſe the curvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linear Parallelogram. The third is evident from <hi>Conſect.</hi> 2. <hi>Def.</hi> 15. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Becauſe the line B<hi>a</hi> is equal to the ſemi-peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery, which multiplyed by the diameter BC gives the area of the circle. The fourth is ſelf evident; and ſo there remains only the ſecond to be demonſtrated, <hi>viz.</hi> That the curvilinear paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram is divided into two equal parts by the cycloid, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the external trilinear Figure A<hi>adb</hi>A is eqaal to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one A<hi>aa</hi>BDA; which may be thus ſhewn: Having divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the baſe B<hi>a</hi> into three equal parts, and drawn thro' them three ſemi-circles, and moreover the tranſverſe right lines D<hi>d</hi> and E<hi>e</hi> thro' the interſections of the ſem-icircles and the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloid; it is certain from the geneſis of the cycloid, by vertue of the Conſ. of <hi>Def.</hi> 11. that as the right line <hi>a</hi>1 is a third part of the whole <hi>a</hi>B, ſo the arch 1<hi>a</hi> is a third part of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating periphery, and by the ſame reaſon the arch 2<hi>a</hi> two thirds, and ſo the remaining arch <hi>a</hi>11 alſo ⅓; inſomuch that the firſt arch 1<hi>a,</hi> and the laſt <hi>a</hi>11, and conſequently their right ſines <hi>af, ag,</hi> and likewiſe their verſed ones <hi>f</hi>1, <hi>g</hi>11, are equal, and ſo the curvilined partial Parallelograms, both above and below, all upon equal baſes, and of the ſame height (<hi>viz.</hi> the two linear ones <hi>ae</hi>21 and <hi>da</hi> 11. 1.) are equal among themſelves, and ſo likewiſe the two pricked or pointed ones D<hi>a</hi> 2B and <hi>aeb</hi>1. Wherefore if now the baſe B<hi>a (n.</hi> 2) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be divided into ſix equal parts, and having drawn ſemi-circles, and tranſverſe lines thro' their interſections with the cycloid, the arches and

                                 <hi>CLavius</hi> was alſo of this Opinion in the book afore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, who thought that if the quadratrix be excluded out of the number of geometrical curves, by the ſame reaſon you may alſo exclude the ellipſe, parabola, and hyperbola, ſince they as well as this are commonly deſcribed thro' innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable points. But by that great Man's leave, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this conſequence, by the ſame reaſon as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the converſe of it in his <hi>Geom.</hi> p 18. and 19. by vertue of which he ſuſpects the ancients took the conick ſections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for mechanick or non-geometrick lines, becauſe they did the <hi>ſpiral,</hi> quadratrix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſuch. But this is the difference between the deſcription of the quadratrix and the conick ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thro' points, that all and every of the points of the conick ſections, relating to any given point of the axis, may be geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically determin'd; but all the points of the quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix promiſcuouſly related to any point of the generating qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, cannot be geometrically determin'd, but only thoſe which reſpect ſome certain point, from which the quadrant may be divided into two arches of known proportion. For if, <hi>e g.</hi> in the quadrant BD the point X be given at pleaſure, it will be impoſſible by <hi>Clavius</hi>'s Rule to define a point of the quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix anſwering to it, becauſe the proportion of the arches DX and BX is unknown, and conſequently neither can a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſection of the right line AD be made: Not to mention that the laſt point E (which is the primary and moſt neceſſary one to the quadrature) even by <hi>Clavius</hi>'s own confeſſion cannot be geometrically defined. We may paſs the like judgment on <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s ſpiral and ſuch like curves, which are conceiv'd to be deſcribed by two motions independent on one another; as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43963:143"/> will be manifeſt to any one who compares the geneſis of the ſpiral with that of the quadratrix and what we have hitherto ſaid. Whence neither will <hi>Monantholius</hi>'s triſection of a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven angle (which he eſſays) by means of a ſpiral be enough geometrical; which in his Book <hi>de Puncto, Cap.</hi> 7. p. 24. he attempts to perform thus: To the centre of a deſcribed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and its firſt helical or ſpiral line BA (<hi>Fig.</hi> 151.) he applies the angle ABC equal to the given one <hi>abc;</hi> then having drawn circles thro' F and A where the legs of the angle cut the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he divides the intermediate ſpace DA into three equal parts in 1, and K: And then thro' theſe points he draws circles cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the helix in L and M; and laſtly having drawn BLN, BMO, he eaſily demonſtrates from the geneſis of the ſpiral that the arches AO, ON, NC are equal. And ſo after the ſame manner not only any angle or arch, but the whole peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery may be geometrically divided into as many parts as you pleaſe; only ſuppoſing that this ſpiral line may be numbred among geometrical ones; as we have heretofore hinted that the cycloid, conchoid, ciſſoid, and logarithmical curve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be; and we have above ſixteen Years ago declared our opinion for it in our <hi>German</hi> Edition of <hi>Archimedes;</hi> and now are therein confirm d by thoſe celebrated Mathematicians <hi>Leib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz, Craige, &amp;c.</hi> who number lines of this kind, altho' they cannot be expreſſed by our common equations, among geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical ones, notwithſtanding the contrary opinion of <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they admit of equations of an indefinite or tranſcendent degree, and are capable of a <hi>Calculus</hi> as well as others, tho' it be of a nature and kind different from that commonly uſed.

                  <p>SINCE thoſe ingenious Mathematicians of this preſent Age, which is now drawing to a Concluſion, <hi>Vieta, Ougthred, Harriot, Cartes, Schooten, Beaune, Van Hudde, Heuraet, de Witte,</hi> and <hi>Sluſius,</hi> and ſeveral other Famous Men coeval with them, have by their Endeavours improved the <hi>Algebra</hi> of the Ancients, raiſed it to vaſtly an higher pitch, and brought it from Numbers to univerſal Symbols, and not only found the excellent uſes of it in Geometry themſelves, but alſo communicated them to others; almoſt all Countries have furniſhed us with ſome excellent Perſons, who treading in the footſteps of their Predeceſſors, have endeavoured to advance it yet further: And even our Times are not without thoſe of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rank, as <hi>Wallis, Baker, Renaldinus, Mengolius, Hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geas, Malbranch, Leibnitz, Craan,</hi> and ſeveral others, who endeavour to promote this Science, deſervedly reputed the very <hi>Apex</hi> of Humane Reaſon, and carry it more and more towards its utmoſt Perfection by dayly augmenting it with new and curious Inventions. But in the mean time, while theſe ingenious Men wholly buſie themſelves in promoting it, there are few found who condeſcend to explain the firſt Principles of it, and ſhew a ready way to young Beginners to arrive at the knowledge of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. It is not long ſince a certain Friend of mine, who for ſome time has publickly and ſucceſsfully taught theſe Sciences,
<pb facs="tcp:43963:147"/> complain'd to me by his Letters, of the want of a good Guide to Specious Analyſis, whereby he might inſtill the Principles of that admirable Art into his Auditors.

                  <p>THE <hi>Analytick Art,</hi> or <hi>Specious Analyſis,</hi> is ſolely ſubvervient to finding of Theorems, and reſolving Problems, by leading us from certain <hi>Data</hi> or given Quantities, into the knowledge of unknown and ſought ones, by a Chain of certain and infallible Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: This admirable Artifice may be reduced to four Primary Heads, <hi>viz. Denomination, Reduction, Equation,</hi> and <hi>Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (if the Problem be a Geometrical one)</hi> or <hi>Conſtruction.</hi>
